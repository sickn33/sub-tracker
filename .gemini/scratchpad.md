# Project Status Board

## Current Status

- **Phase**: Complete
- **Status**: Implemented subscription notifications via Calendar Export and Browser Alerts.

## Tasks

- ID: T01
  Goal: Implement subscription renewal notifications
  Success Criteria: User receives a notification before a subscription renews.
  Test Case: Manual verification (import ICS file).
  Status: done

## Lessons

- Google Tasks API is restrictive; VTODO in ICS is the best "automatic" client-side workaround.

## Executor's Feedback

- Implementation went smoothly. Added comprehensive unit tests for the logic.
